<h1 align="center">A Flash(bot) in the Pan</h1>

A collection of tools to measure and analyze frontrunning attacks on private pools such as [Flashbots](https://docs.flashbots.net). Our paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2206/2206.04185.pdf).

## Installation Instructions

``` shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notebooks
The bulk of the analysis was done in Jupyter notebooks, which can be opened by
